WMAConvert
==========

This is a crappy program I put together in the space of an hour and a half. It's a bit hacky and the code is really dirty (I put it together using WindowBuilder).

Its sole purpose is to convert WMAs to MP3s using VLC's conversion capabilities. It contains Windows-specific stuff.

I'll clean it up eventually.
